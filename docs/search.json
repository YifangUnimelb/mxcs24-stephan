    "text": "Abstract. This project employs a Bayesian Vector Autoregression (BVAR) model to forecast Australian real wages growth rates for future periods. Beginning in 2021, Australian households experienced negative growth rates in real wages, but recent trends indicate a rebound. Therefore, a positive trajectory in real wages growth rate is anticipated for the upcoming periods.\nKeywords. BVARs, Real Wages Growth Rates, Inflation, Households"

Notably, the Wage Price Index (WPI) has shown an upward trajectory recently, while the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has concurrently exhibited a decline. This divergence has facilitated a recovery in the real WPI from previously negative growth rates experienced in the post-COVID period. Additionally, significant increases have been observed in the growth rates of the Cost of Living Index and the Producer Price Index, highlighting notable shifts in economic conditions."
